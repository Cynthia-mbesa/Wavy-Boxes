			<p>I'll miss knowin' what you're thinkin'
			And hearin' how your day has been
			Do you think you can tell me everything, darling?
			But leave out every part about him
			Right now you're probably by the ocean
			While I'm still out here in the rain
			With every day that passes by since we've spoken
			It's like Glasgow gets further from LA
			Maybe it's supposed to be this way
			But, oh, my love
			I wanna say I miss the green in your eyes
			And when I said we could be friends, guess I lied
			I wanna say I wish that you never left
			Oh, but instead I only wish you the best
			I wanna say without you, everything's wrong
			And you were everything I need all along
			I wanna say I wish that you never left
			Oh, but instead I only wish you the best
			Well, I can't help but notice
			You seem happier than ever now
			And I guess that I should tell you I'm sorry
			It seems I was the problem somehow
			Maybe I only brought you down</p>
